2.2. Effective Date\par
\par
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\par
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\par
     such Contribution.\par
\par
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\par
\par
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\par
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\par
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\par
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\par
\par
     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\par
\par

        Version); or\par
\par
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\par
        Contributions.\par
\par
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\par
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\par
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\par
\par
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\par
\par
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\par
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\par
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\par
     under the terms of Section 3.3).\par
\par
2.5. Representation\par
\par
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\par
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\par
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\par
\par
2.6. Fair Use\par
\par
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\par
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\par
\par
2.7. Conditions\par
\par
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\par
     Section 2.1.\par
\par
\par
3. Responsibilities\par
\par
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\par
\par
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\par
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\par
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\par
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\par
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\par
     restrict the recipients\rquote  rights in the Source Code Form.\par
\par
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\par
\par
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\par
\par
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\par
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\par
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\par
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\par
        of distribution to the recipient; and\par
\par
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\par
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\par
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\rquote\par
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\par
\par
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\par
\par
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\par
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\par
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\par
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\par
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\par
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\par
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\par
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\par
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\par
\par
3.4. Notices\par
\par
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\par
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\par
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\par
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\par
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\par
\par
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\par
\par
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\par
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\par
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\par
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\par
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\par
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\par
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\par
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\par
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\par
     jurisdiction.\par
\par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\par
\par
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\par
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\par
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\par
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\par
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\par
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\par
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\par
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\par
   understand it.\par
\par
5. Termination\par
\par
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\par
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\par
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\par
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\par
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\par
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\par
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\par
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\par
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\par
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\par
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\par
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\par
\par
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\par
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\par
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\par
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\par
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\par
     shall terminate.\par
\par
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\par
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\par
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\par
     termination shall survive termination.\par
\par
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\par
\par
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without\par
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\par
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\par
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\par
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\par
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\par
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\par
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\par
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\par
   except under this disclaimer.\par
\par
7. Limitation of Liability\par
\par
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\par
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\par
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\par
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\par
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\par
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\par
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\par
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\par
   party\rquote s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\par
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\par
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
8. Litigation\par
\par
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\par
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\par
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\par
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\par
   prevent a party\rquote s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\par
\par
9. Miscellaneous\par
\par
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\par
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\par
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\par
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\par
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\par
   this License against a Contributor.\par
\par
\par
10. Versions of the License\par
\par
10.1. New Versions\par
\par
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\par
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\par
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\par
      distinguishing version number.\par
\par
10.2. Effect of New Versions\par
\par
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\par
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\par
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\par
      steward.\par
\par
10.3. Modified Versions\par
\par
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\par
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\par
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\par
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\par
      modified license differs from this License).\par
\par
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\par
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\par
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\par
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\par

\par
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then\par
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant\par
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\par
\par
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\par
\par
